ðŸš§ Work in Progress: Against The Herd â€“ Socratic Questioning Meets Systems Thinking ðŸ“–

Iâ€™m writing a book about how social systems, groupthink, and perceived norms quietly shape the way we think, behave, and stay silent.

Blending Socratic questioning, systems thinking, and personal observation, Iâ€™m exploring the unspoken assumptions that govern modern discourse â€” and why simply asking the right questions can feel so disruptive in a conformist world.

Itâ€™s raw, evolving, and not here to preach â€” just to make sense of things we often accept without questioning.

If this resonates with you, Iâ€™d love to connect, exchange ideas, or share early drafts. I'm building this in public â€” curious minds welcome.
